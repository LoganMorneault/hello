# Hello!

Hi stranger! If you're reading this, you're likely looking to take a look at some of the code I've written. Unfortunately, much of what I've made has been for school projects, and policy requires that I do not make this work public. I am allowed to make exceptions, so long as I ask, so if you'd like me to make something public for a brief time please contact me at loganmorneault@gmail.com so I can do so.


My private repositories are as follows:

Java
- minesweeper, a single file, fully funcitonal minesweeper game played in a separate window.
- pyramid-solitaire, a program that supports three different kinds of pyramid solitaire played in the command line.
- animator, a program that animates a given file in one of four supported formats, including text, svg, and a separate window.

C++
- c-string, code implementing multiple functions in C++ and C's string.h library.

I have work for a programming in C++ class that hasn't yet made it to GitHub, but it should be up soon. I am also currently taking classes on Algorithms, Computer Systems, and Cybersecurity, so expect projects related to those as it becomes available.
