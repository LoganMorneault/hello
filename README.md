# Hello!

If you're reading this, you probably want to take a look at some of the code I've written. Unfortunately, much of what I've made has been for school projects and policy requires that I do not make this work public. I am allowed to make individual repositories public for several days at a time so long as I get permission from course staff,  so if you'd like me to view my work please contact me at loganmorneault@gmail.com or morneault.l@northeastern.edu so I can do so.

Some of my work is also available on Repl.it, an online code-editing service. Most of it is in C++ and relatively unimportant, although I have also made some games in KaBoom.js that can be played using the links below.
 - [Space Invaders](https://space-invaders.loganmorneault.repl.co/)
 - [Super Mario](https://super-mario.loganmorneault.repl.co/)


My private repositories are as follows:

Java
- minesweeper, a single file, fully funcitonal minesweeper game played in a separate window.
- pyramid-solitaire, a program that supports three different kinds of pyramid solitaire played in the command line.
- animator, a program that animates a given file in one of four supported formats, including text, svg, and a separate window.

C++
- c-string, code implementing multiple functions in C++ and C's string.h library.
- dlldeque, code implementing a doubly-linked list, associated methods, and an iterator.
- pathfinding, code implementing the A* Search and Breadth-First Search algorithms.

I've also written a number-recognition program in Racket and a basic implementation of Pong in Lua, although the hard drive these were stored on has since failed and I am unable to retrieve them.
